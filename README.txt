1. Ali Jamil Official Website
This is the official website of Ali Jamil. Showcasing his professional experience, interests, goals and aspirations.

2. Project Description
Started in June 2022, alijamil.com has evolved overtime. While this is his first website, Ali has carefully taken the time to perfect all aspects of the website and debug any 
errors and lapses that take away from the overall UI/UX experience. 

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

3. Include Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.

Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

7. Add a License
For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.

8. Badges
Badges aren't necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know that you know what you're doing.

Having this section can also be helpful to help link to important tools and also show some simple stats about your project like the number of forks, contributors, open issues etc...

Below is a screenshot from one of my projects that shows how you can make use of badges:
